    "Linear Regression is one of the fundamental methods of computational science.  There are many books entirely dedicated to the subject and it is often taught as a course in graduate school. Does that mean it's hard to understand? No. It's not necessarily that hard to understand! However, it provides a very rich context for \"details\" that \"can\" go very deep. It can also be presented in in many different contexts and is a useful tool for any kind of scientist or computer professional to know. **I will focus on Linear Regression in the context and language of Machine Learning. It will provide a simple but rich and useful example of many of the key concepts and methods used in Machine Learning.**\n",

    "In general Mathematics is very concise and, of course, it's all about abstraction. **\"Things\" are what you define them to be!** The extreme example of trying to standardize notation and definitions is the old French [Bourbaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki). [ This was a bunch of mathematicians that collectively published under the name \"Nicolas Bourbaki\". Fascinating! ] They were obsessive about notation and definition. In my opinion Statistics is the opposite of that :-) Statistics always felt like a rouge field of mathematics to me personally [ don't get me wrong, I think Statistics is one of the most interesting fields of mathematics! ]. I believe some of the common statistics notation and language is part of what can make it difficult to understand. This applies to Machine Learning literature too since one of the short definitions of Machine Learning is that **it is Statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have noticed that people without much mathematics background can really get hung-up badly on notation. **Keep in mind that notation is just visual symbols that have no meaning in and of themselves. It's the values/functions that you assign to them that have meaning.** If you ever get lost it's good to write down the symbols that are being used and be sure you know what they actually refer to and note their \"sizes\" and counting indices's (index symbols like subscript or superscript i,j,k, (i) etc. ) \n",

    "## Linear Regression is \"Supervised Learning\"\n",
    "In Machine Learning speak, Linear Regression is a type of supervised learning. By \"supervised learning\" we mean that you you have a set of data (a training set) where you know the \"right answers\". That is for some feature (input) you know a corresponding \"answer\" (output) of some question for every data point in your training set. For example, you know the *price* a house sold for (answer) and the *square foot living space* of that house (feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "When look at your data you will have some expected or presumed relationship between those features and answers (input and output). You will be trying to find a model function of that relationship that will let you predict answers for new input data that was not in your training data. You are trying to find a (linear) model that \"fits\" the data according to some \"goodness\" criteria. The \"fit\" model hopefully represents the data realistically and gives a way to generalize the data and estimate missing/unknown values and perhaps predict future trends. **The training or fitting is the Machine Learning part. The model that can be used to predict things is the \"Artificial Intelligence\" part (it may be pretty stupid \"intelligence\" :-).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The word **regression** is referring to finding the best parameters for a model of data that is **continuous**. For example, the *price* of a house given it's size in square feet, or, the change of a *stock price* over time, or, the change in blood-pressure based on your salt intake, etc.. **The \"answer\" has a continuous range of values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another common type of supervised learning is \"Classification\".** That would be the case where your data is labeled by some kind of **discrete** categories. For example, a set of images of cats and dogs. With this kind of data you are more concerned in finding a model that describes the boundaries between the categories.\n",

    "## What does Linear mean?\n",
    "There are mathematical definitions of what linear really means but it is OK to go with the intuitive idea of \"line like\", i.e. not curving. It is a property of how things \"combine\" too (combining with a simple sum). For functions (mappings from one thing to another) we can write \"linear functions\". If our function only has one variable (or feature) then the it can be represented as the equation of a straight line, $y=f(x)=ax+b$. If there are two variables or features then it would look like a flat plane (like a table top). You can have more variables for a linear function but you can't easily visualize it. The linear regression problem we look at first will just have one variable (for now) i.e. it will result in a straight line. I will describe this function in more detail in the next post in this series but for right now I want to show what it is and make a comment about how to start thinking about it and the language we will use to talk about it.\n",

    "$h_a(x)$ above can also be thought of as a function of it's **parameters** $a_0$ and $a_1$!! **This is very important!** It can be confusing. The subscript $a$ is to remind you of the parameters. You can look at how the equation of the line represented the $h_a(x)$ changes when you change the vaules of the parameters $a_0$ and $a)1$.  When you are training a model you are fitting the model to your **data** by varying the values of the **parameters** (or weights) to find values that minimize the errors between the predicted values given by $h(x)$ and the known values in your data set. Your focus during the training is on the parameters, not the **features** $x$. You do this by deriving a new function called the **Cost Function** (or error function) that uses $h_a$. The **Cost function is a function of the parameters $a$**.\n",
