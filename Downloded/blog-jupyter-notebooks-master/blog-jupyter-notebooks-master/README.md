Jupyter notebooks from my blog posts at [Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/all_hpc.php)

- **ML-LR-part1.ipynb** -- **Introduction** to this series of posts about Linear Regression. I'm using this series as way to illustrate some of the key ideas of Machine Learning via a detailed analysis of Linear Regression.
- **ML-LR-part2.ipynb** -- **Getting and Evaluating Data** This notebook talks about pulling the King county house prices data-set from Kaggle and doing some visual analysis. To decide on a good data subset for the LR analysis.
- **ML-LR-part3.ipynb** -- **Model and Cost Function** an analysis and visualization of the linear model and cost function.
- **ML-LR-part4.ipynb** -- **Parameter Optimization by Gradient Decent** description, derivation, code and plots for gradient decent for linear regression.
- **df_98039.csv** -- King county house sales data for zipcode 98039, price and sqft_living.
- **kc_house_data.csv** -- King county house sales data, full.
- **ML-LR-part5.ipynb** -- **Vectorization and Matrix Equations** Derivation of the matrix equations including the gradient derivation and solution with the Moore-Penrose inverse.
- **ML-LR-part6.ipynb** -- **Over/Under fitting and Non-Linear Feature Variables** Last post in the linear regression series. Examples of using non-linear feature variables and the problem of over-fitting.
- **ML-Logistic-Regression-theory.ipynb** -- **Logistic Regression Theory** Discussion of the sigmoid function, how things work and derivation of equations including the gradient of the cost function in matrix form.
- **ML-Logistic-Regression-Regularization.ipynb** -- **Logistic and Linear Regression Regularization** Regularization to avoid over-fitting.
- **CHDAGE.zip** Data set of presence or absence of coronary heart disease by age. One of the Logistic Regression examples ...
- **ML-Logistic-Regression-examples1** -- **2D data fit with multinomial model and 0 1 digits classification on MNIST dataset**  Also, some bug fixes to functions from the regularization notebook. Use these instead!  
- **ML-Logistic-Regression-multinomial -- **Logistic Regression: Multi-Class (Multinomial) -- Full MNIST digits classification example**  Multi-class classification with MNIST digits example
